# cargo-nx

## Introduction

`cargo-nx` is a simple build command for projects based on this organization's libraries and tools, to avoid having to mess with makefiles, scripts or having several copies of the same linker/target files for every single project, while also including support for generating various formats after projects are compiled.

## Installation

Assuming you have Rust and `cargo` installed, it's just a matter of two steps:

1) If not already installed, install `rust-src`:

    ```bash
    rustup component add rust-src
    ```

2) Install `cargo-nx`:

    ```bash
    cargo install cargo-nx --git https://github.com/aarch64-switch-rs/cargo-nx
    ```

## Usage

The program can be executed as `cargo-nx` or simply as a cargo subcommand, `cargo nx`, and it provides the following main subcommands:

### `new` subcommand

This subcommand is quite similar to the usual `cargo new` subcommand.

Base format: `cargo nx new <path> [<params/flags>]`

Available parameters/flags

- `--name`: Specify the package name (default is the input path's directory name)

- `--edition`: Specify the package edition (available editions: [2015, 2018, 2021], default is 2021)

- `--type <package type>`: Specify the package type to create. `lib`, `nro`, and `nsp` are available, with `nro` being the default.

### `build` subcommand

This subcommand is quite similar to the normal `cargo build` subcommand.

Base format: `cargo nx build [<params/flags>]`

Available parameters/flags:

- `-r`, `--release`: Builds on release profile, same as the normal `cargo build --release` option.

- `-p <path>`, `--path=<path>`: Specifies a path with a crate to build (containing `Cargo.toml`, etc.), since the current directory is used by default otherwise.

- `-t <triple>`, `--triple=<triple>`: Specifies the target triple, which is "aarch64-none-elf" by default.

- `-c`, `--use-custom-target`: Notifies the program to not use the default target JSON/linker script, which can be used to use custom ones.

- `-v`, `--verbose`: Displays extra information during the build process.

## Package formats

Build format fields used for building must be placed placed inside `[package.metadata.nx.<format>]` in `Cargo.toml`. These fields vary depending on the project's format.

The program itself detects the target format when parsing `Cargo.toml`. Note that multiple formats at the same time are not currently supported.

Projects without specific build format fields, like libraries, can also be compiled. This can be useful to later generate custom executables instead of being generated by this subcommand.

### NRO

Projects which generate homebrew NRO binaries don't have any mandatory fields, but only optional ones.

- Example:

```toml
[package]
name = "Project"
version = "0.1.0"
authors = ["XorTroll"]
edition = "2021"

[package.metadata.nx.nro]
romfs = "romfs_dir"
icon = "icon.jpg"
nacp = { default_name = "Sample project", default_author = "XorTroll", version = "0.1 beta" }
```

> Note: the `romfs` and `icon` fields must point to items located relative to the project's directory

The fields present on the `nacp` object, all of them optional, are the following:

| Field                  | Value                                                            | Description                                               | Default value           |

| BrazilianPortuguese  | pt-BR          |

> Note: languages in the titles object can be specified by their names or their codes, as the JSON example above shows.

- Example with specific languages:

```toml
[package]
name = "Multi-language"
version = "0.2.0"
authors = ["XorTroll"]
edition = "2021"

[package.metadata.nx.nro.nacp]
default_name = "A"
default_author = "B"
version = "0.2 beta"
titles = { ja = { name = "J" }, LatinAmericanSpanish = { author = "X" }, it = { name = "I", author = "T" } }
```

```bash
Names/authors produced above:

- Japanese: "J", "B"
- LatinAmericanSpanish: "A", "X"
- Italian: "I", "T"
- Other languages: "A", "B"
```

> Note: only `name` and `author` fields can be language-specific

### NSP

Projects which generate sysmodule NSP exefs packages need a single, mandatory field for the NPDM data, which would be `npdm` for specifying it on the TOML itself or `npdm_json` for using an external JSON file:

- Example:

```toml
[package]
name = "Project"
version = "0.2.10"
authors = ["XorTroll"]
edition = "2021"

[package.metadata.nx.nsp.npdm]
name = "ProjectNpdm"
signature_key_generation = 0
main_thread_stack_size = "0x20000"
main_thread_priority = 49
main_thread_core_number = 3
system_resource_size = 0
version = 0
address_space_type = 1
is_64_bit = true
optimize_memory_allocation = false
disable_device_address_space_merge = false
is_production = true
unqualified_approval = false
memory_region = 2
program_id = "0x0100AAAABBBBCCCC"

[package.metadata.nx.nsp.npdm.fs_access_control]
flags = "0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF"

[package.metadata.nx.nsp.npdm.service_access_control]
accessed_services = [ "fsp-srv", "ncm" ]
hosted_services = [ "demo:srv" ]

[package.metadata.nx.nsp.npdm.kernel_capabilities]
highest_priority = 63
lowest_priority = 16
max_core_number = 3
min_core_number = 3
enable_system_calls = [
    "SetHeapSize"
]
kernel_version = "3.0"
```

- Example using an external NPDM JSON:

```toml
[package]
name = "Project"
version = "0.2.10"
authors = ["XorTroll"]
edition = "2021"

[package.metadata.nx.nsp]
npdm_json = "npdm.json"
```

> Note: the NPDM JSON file follows the same format used in most other homebrews (check projects like [Atmosphere](https://github.com/Atmosphere-NX/Atmosphere/blob/master/stratosphere/sm/sm.json), [emuiibo](https://github.com/XorTroll/emuiibo/blob/master/emuiibo/npdm.json), [ldn_mitm](https://github.com/spacemeowx2/ldn_mitm/blob/master/ldn_mitm/res/app.json)...) and, like with the paths in the NRO format, it must be relative to the project's directory

### Libraries

Library projects have nothing special in their Cargo.toml

## Credits

- [linkle](https://github.com/MegatonHammer/linkle) libraries as the core element of this project
- [cargo-count](https://github.com/kbknapp/cargo-count) as the example followed to make a cargo subcommand project
